def solve_assignment(units, stations, emergency, costs, avail_units):
	"""
	Solves the assignment problem for dispatching multiple types of emergency vehicles.

	Inputs:
	- units (set[int]): A set of indices representing different types of emergency vehicles 
	(e.g., engine, ladder, medic, ambulance).
	- stations (dict[int, tuple[float, float]]): A dictionary mapping station indices to their geographic coordinates.
	Each key-value pair (j, (l1, l2)) represents station j at location (latitude l1, longitude l2).
	- emergency (int): An integer representing the type of emergency, which determines the required vehicle types.
	- costs (list[float]): A list of size J (where J is the number of stations), containing (cost/time of dispatching, noise).
	- avail_units (dict[list[int]]): A dictionary mapping station indices to what vehicles are available.
	Each key-value pair (j, L) represents station j having the vehicles in the list L, where L[i] denotes how many
	units of vehicle type i station j has.

	Returns:
	- dict[int, list[int]]: A dictionary mapping vehicle_type -> [station_number for number_of_units_dispatched].
	Each key i represents vehicle type i being dispatched, where the value contains station number j for however 
	many vehicles are being assigned from that station.
